# Project1

## Project Description

In this project, we are to build an console application that communicates from the API client to the API server and then to the Database.
In this project you have the ability to Register or Login as an manager or employee. 

As an employee, you can request reimbursements by giving an amout, description, and optionally a reimbursement type (Food, Travel, Lodging, Other) and optionally an image of a receipt. An employee can also see past reimbursemetns and sort them by Reimbursement types or by pending, approved, or denied reimbursements. In addition, an employee can also edit their profile by adding/updating their name, address, or profile picture. An employee can also view their profile picture.

As a manager:, you are able to check for pending reimbusements and either approve or decline the reimbursements. The manager can also promote or demote a user (employee or manager). As a manager, you can also view a reciept that has been attached to a specific reimbursements request.
